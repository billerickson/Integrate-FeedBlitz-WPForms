Create FeedBlitz signup forms using WPForms

== Description ==

"Integrate FeedBlitz and WPForms" easily connects forms on your website to your [FeedBlitz](https://www.feedblitz.com/) email marketing account, enabling you to capture more leads and manage campaigns more effectively.

[WPForms](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=402581&b=834775&m=64312&afftrack=emma%2Dplugin&urllink=)' simple drag-and-drop form builder allows you to create new forms with ease and its clean, modern code makes customizations a snap. This integration also works with the free version, [WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/), but I highly recommend purchasing the full WPForms for the valuable premium features and support.

== Installation ==

 1. Install this plugin, along with [WPForms](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=402581&b=834775&m=64312&afftrack=emma%2Dplugin&urllink=) (or [WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)).
 2. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to WPForms > Add New and create a form. You can add whatever fields you like, but at a minimum you must include an Email and Name field.
 3. Click “Settings” in the left column, then select "FeedBlitz". From the dropdowns, select the Email, First Name, and Last Name fields you created.
 4. In a separate browser tab, go to FeedBlitz, log in, and click Integrations. Copy the API key to the WPForms FeedBlitz settings page.
 5. Click “Save” in the top right corner, and exit out of the form builder.
 6. Insert the form somewhere on your site and test it out! Go to Pages, select a page, and above the content editor click “Add Form”. Select your form and click “Insert” to add it to the page.
